# DataWare Project Migration to OOP
## Overview
This project involves migrating the existing DataWare project from a procedural approach to an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture. The primary goal is to enhance modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. As a bonus, the implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern will be considered for improved code structure and clear separation of responsibilities.
